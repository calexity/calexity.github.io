		<h1>Happy Birthday Julio!</h1>
		<h2>In honor of your birthday, I put some of my favorite Julio moments on this webpage.</h2> <h3>(It looks like it's from 1996 because I'm not very good at making webpages.)</h3>

	<p><strong>Me</strong> "What size do you wear?" <br>
	<strong>Julio</strong> "Large."<br>
	<strong>Me</strong> "They run kind of big."<br>
	<strong>Julio</strong> "Well, large americans are large."
