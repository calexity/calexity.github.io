    <h1>About</h1>

<p>This is an about page.  It should have some content.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why a cake is usually round? Some think it has to do with its origins, when cake more closely resembled bread. Grains were crushed, moistened, mixed together, compacted, and formed by hand. The end "cake" was round, the same shape today's homemade breads take while they're in the rising process. It's believed that these simple cakes were then cooked on a hot stone.</p>

<p>These cakes may have been made as early as the last period of the Stone Age, based on evidence that archaeologists have discovered in the remains of Neolithic villages. Later, ancient Egyptians developed ovens, which offered a far more reliable method of baking. The Greeks introduced cakes, called "plakous" (which means "flat") that were generally a combination of nuts and honey.</p>

<p>In the Roman period things really started cooking -- or baking, as it were. The Romans "satura," or flat, heavy cakes, featured ingredients such as barley, raisins, pine nuts, pomegranate seeds, and sweet wine. Another popular cake of the time was "libum," the predecessor to the modern-day cheesecake, which was primarily used as an offering to the gods. (Jupiter evidently wasn't a calorie watcher.) In the latter years of the Roman Empire, yeast was introduced to cake-making, as well as butter, cream, eggs, spices, and sugar.</p>

<p>The evolution of cake continued during the Renaissance period, when Italians introduced "biscuits." Food historians consider these to be the first sponge cakes, although these thin, crisp cakes probably resembled a cookie more than a cake. In the mid-18th century, beaten eggs replaced yeast as the leavening agent of choice, and cakes were poured into molds or shape-setting hoops -- early bakeware which set the stage for today's cake pans.</p>
